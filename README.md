## Problem Statement
Sameer is a young man, based in Indore, he has big dreams about his dad's furniture manufacturing business which he'll be soon taking up.

But he feels helpless as he doesn't have a big network and doesn't know a lot of people from the industry. Moreover setting up meetings with raw sellers and travelling cross town is very exhausting and inefficient. 

On top of that he has no analysis of what his customers like and the piling up dead stock is adding insult to injury.

This is when sameer comes to know about Nirman Gati. Which is an AI/ML based business optimizationÂ platform.
