## Problem Statement
Local manufacturers face significant challenges in:
- **Inefficient demand forecasting**
- **Inventory management issues**
- **Unsustainable practices**, leading to:
  - Higher operational costs
  - Increased resource wastage
  - Missed optimization opportunities

## Features

### 1. Vendor Connection & Material Sourcing
As a manufacturer or a shop owner (e.g., Raj, a sofa maker), you can use **Nirman Gati** to:
- Enter your material requirements.
- Get connected with vendors offering the best prices.
- Negotiate the final price through the app.
- Once the material is sourced, it will be sent to our warehouse for quality inspection before itâ€™s delivered to your shop.

### 2. Quality Assurance & Warehouse Delivery
- Materials are delivered to our warehouse where their quality is thoroughly checked.
- After passing quality assurance, materials are then sent to your shop with **optimized routing**, minimizing carbon emissions in the process.

### 3. Inventory Management & Tracking
- **Real-time tracking** of your inventory. 
- When a product (like a sofa) is sold, the app automatically reduces the corresponding stock from your inventory.
- **AI-powered recommendations**: On special occasions or based on trends, the app will recommend how many units you should stock up on to avoid running out of stock.

## How It Works

1. **Input Requirements**: As a manufacturer, you enter your material requirements for production (e.g., materials to make sofas).
2. **Vendor Matching**: The app connects you with suppliers who offer the best deals based on your needs.
3. **Quality Check**: Once materials are delivered to our warehouse, we inspect them to ensure quality.
4. **Advanced Routing**: Materials are delivered to your shop using an optimized routing system that reduces carbon emissions.
5. **Inventory Management**: The app tracks inventory in real time. It automatically adjusts your stock count when items are sold and gives you AI-driven recommendations for future stock levels.

## Additional Features
- **Sustainability**: By reducing unnecessary transportation and improving routing efficiency, we actively contribute to reducing the carbon footprint of your business.
- **AI-Driven Insights**: The app uses artificial intelligence to give you suggestions on inventory based on your sales data, ensuring you are never overstocked or understocked.
